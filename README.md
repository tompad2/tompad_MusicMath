# tompad_MusicMath

tompad_MusicMath is a reascript to get ms from bpm in a Reaperproject.

When script window is opened, it takes the current bpm from
Reaper and by choosing note buttons it convert bpm to ms.

By clicking the resulting ms-text the script is copying the
ms to the systems clipboard (for pasting in to delay f.ex)
